# Electron_Manga_App_Test
Tried to learn electron by coding a manga reading app.

Websites i use to read manga often do not have everything available, so i will have to find different sources - this app will allow me to quickly search and read manga from the two websites i use the most. 

I get manga from Mangadex (API) and Manganato (Webscraping - puppeteer, cheerio)

## **Added Functionalities:**
- Ability to view manga from Mangadex & Manganato
- Search
- Read manga
- Ability to continuously scroll to the next chatper
- Manga age classification (Suggestive, 18+, etc.)

## **Video examples:**
Ability to choose source

## **Yet to implement:**
- Filter/ Sort ( Manga currently displayed by latest)
- Quick switching between sources when reading (If the source currently being used is too slow)
- Fix bug where scrolling over to next page
